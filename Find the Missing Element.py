'''
Find the Missing Element
Problem
Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.

Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.

Input:

finder([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[3,7,2,1,4,6])

Output:

5 is the missing number

    for i in arr2:

            cur[i] -= 1


    for i in cur:
        if cur[i] !=0:
